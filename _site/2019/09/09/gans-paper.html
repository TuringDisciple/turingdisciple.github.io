    <p><em>I want to start doing blog posts on papers that I am currently reading, or papers that I love. This is the first in the series and it is the paper which proposed the GAN, one of the most exciting neural network models around that has gotten quite a lot of attention due to results.</em></p>

<h1 id="what-is-this-about">What is this about?</h1>
<p>Notes on the the generative adversarial nets paper by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">Goodfellow et.al</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The basic idea of the adversarial nets framework is that we have a generative model which is pitted against an adversary: a discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the data distribution.</p>

<p>A good analogy for this network is imagine a counterfeiter pitted against anti-fraud police. Ultimately the criminal party is trying to create currency that is indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>

<p>A benefit of these networks is that there’s no dependence on approximate inference and Markov chains. This model is simply trained using back-propagation and sampled using forward propagation.</p>

<h2 id="formal-definition">Formal Definition</h2>
<p>To learn the generators distribution $p_g$ over data $\mathbf{x}$ we a define a prior on input noise variables $p_{\mathbf{z}}(\mathbf{z})$ thene represent a mapping to data space as $G(\mathbf{z}; \theta_g)$ where $G$ is a differentiable function represented by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with parameters $\theta_g$. We define a second MLP $D(\mathbf{x};\theta_d)$ that outputs a single scalar $D(\mathbf{x})$ that represents the probability that $\mathbf{x}$ came from the data rather than from $p_g$. $D$ is trained to maximize the probability of assigning the correct label to both training examples and samples from $G$. We simultaneously train $G$ to minimize $\log(1-D(G(\mathbf{x})))$.</p>

<p>$D$ and $G$ play the following minimax game with value function $V(G, D)$</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min_G \max_G V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim p_{data}(\mathbf{x})}[\log\ D(\mathbf{x})] + \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}\sim p_{\mathbf{z}}(\mathbf{z})}[\log\ (1-D(G(\mathbf{z})))]</script>

<p>The problem with the above function is that it may not provide a sufficient gradient for $G$ to learn well. Early in the learning process when $G$ still provides poor samples, $D$ can reject samples with high confidence because they’re clearly different from the training data. Rather than train $G$ to minimize $\log\ 1 - D(G(\mathbf{x}))$ we can train it to maximize $\log\ (D(G(\mathbf{z})))$.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/gans-prob.png" alt="Prob Distribution" /></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates pictorially the idea behind the training process (taken from the source paper). We have five lines: the black dotted line corresponds to the true distribution $p_{data}$. The green line corresponds to the probability of the generative model $p_{g}$. The blue dotted line corresponds to the discriminator probability. The lower horizontal line corresponds to the space in which $\mathbf{z}$ is sampled and the upper horizontal line is the sample space of $\mathbf{x}$. The upwards arrows show the function $\mathbf{x}=G(\mathbf{z})$.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the figure, prior to any training let’s consider the case in which $p_{G}$ is near convergence (a). As can be seen in $a$, the discriminator has no certain accuracy, and the generator isn’t producing convincing samples. (b) shows that $D$ is trained to discrimanate samples from dat, converging to $D^*(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{p_{data}(\mathbf{x})}{p_{data}(\mathbf{x}) + p_g(\mathbf{x})}$. (c) shows that after $G$ is updated, the gradient of $D$ has caused $G$ to flow to regions that are more likely. (d) shows the converged case, where after enough training steps, a point is reached which cannot be improved as $p_g = p_{data}$. The discriminator is unable to differentiate between the two probabilities and therefore $D(x) = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-results">Theoretical Results</h2>
<p>In this section of the paper, Goodfellow et.al define the algorithm which is used to train the model, as well as showing that the minimax game has a global optimum for $p_g=p_{data}$ and that the algorithm provided optimizes the min-max game function above. I would advise, if interested, to read through the proofs of the above in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">original paper</a>. Below is a screen-shot of the algorithm definition taken from the paper:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/gans-alg.png" alt="Algorithm 1" /></p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>Within this part of the paper, the authors show results of their network when trained on different generative model tasks such digit generation, and face and image generation. Again I would advise the reader to look at their results, although it’s worth noting that since the publishing of the paper GANs have been used to obtain much better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=kSLJriaOumA">(and sometimes frightening)</a> results.</p>

<h2 id="advantages-and-disadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No explicit representation of the generative probability</li>
  <li>$D$ must be synchronized with $G$ during training so that $G$ is not trained too much without updates to $D$</li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
  </li>
  <li>No need for Markov chains (only backprop used for training)</li>
  <li>No need for inference during learning</li>
  <li>Supports a wide range of functions</li>
  <li>Can represent “sharp” distributions</li>
  <li>Generator network not updated with data examples directly but only with gradients flowing through the discriminator.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Although this paper was released in 2014, it’s relevance can still be felt today through it’s many extensions. I hope I was able to shine a light on the GANs and the world therein.</p>

A couple of days ago I completed my final year dissertation. It was a research project where I applied programming language theory to assist in formal verification of cryptography.

The full dissertation can be downloaded [here](/assets/diss-final.pdf) or can be accessed via github [here](https://github.com/nashpotato/diss-public).

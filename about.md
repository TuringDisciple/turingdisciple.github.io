What, who, why?
==============

My name is Nashe Mncube, I am a Computer Science student at the Univerisity of Bristol. This blog is primarily an oppurtunity to write down what I am currently studying and learning in my free time. 

I am by no means an expert, so if any mistakes are spotted point them out. Any projects and code that I may write is accessible through [my github](http://github.com/NasheMncube).

Hope you enjoy my content, and stay safe!

What, who, why?
==============

My name is Nashe Mncube, I am a Computer Science student at the Univerisity of Bristol. This blog is primarily an oppurtunity to write down what I am currently studying and learning in my free time. As I write this, I intend for the blog to be mainly used for me to talk about network security, embedded securityand cyber security in general as I teach myself this subject and explore, however it may expand pasti that.

I am by no means an expert, so if any mistakes are spotted point them out. Any projects and code that I may write is accessible through [my github](http://github.com/NasheMncube).

Hope you enjoy my content, and stay safe!
